This folder contains source code and a gradle project for a
command-line app that reimplements the
[SearchTaskGang](https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/LiveLessons/tree/master/SearchTaskGang)
example from my [Java
Concurrency](http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/LiveLessons/CPiJava/)
LiveLessons tutorial to show how Java 8 features, such as lambdas,
method references, sequential and parallel streams, completable
futures, as well as the Java 7 fork-join framework, can be applied to
search for words in a list of input data strings. This app also
compares and contrasts the performance of different concurrency and
parallelism models.
