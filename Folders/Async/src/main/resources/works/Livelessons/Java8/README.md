This directory contains all the small Java 8 source code examples from
my LiveLessons course on [Java
Concurrency](http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/LiveLessons/CPiJava/),
as well as some other examples from my Safari Live Training courses.
Here's an overview of what's included:

. ex1 - This example shows how to use Java 8 lambda expressions and
  method references to sort elements of a collection.  It also shows
  how to use the Java 8 forEach() method.
  
. ex2 - This example shows the use of a simple lambda expression in
  the context of a Java List/ArrayList removeIf() method.
  
. ex3 - This example uses a Java Function-based method reference to
  sort a list of threads by their names.  It also demonstrates the use
  of the Comparator.comparing() factory method.
  
. ex4 - This example shows how a Java 7 BiFunction lambda can be used
  to replace all the values of all keys in a ConcurrentHashMap.  It
  also contrasts the Java 8 BiFunction with a conventional Java 7
  solution using a foreach loop.

. ex5 - This example shows how a Java 8 Consumer interface can be used
  with forEach() to print out the values in a list by binding the
  System.out println() method to the forEach() Consumer parameter.

. ex6 - This example shows how a Java 8 Supplier interface can be used
  to print a default value if a key is not found in a map.  It also
  shows how to use the Java 8 Optional class.
  
. ex7 - This example of shows how the Java 8 Supplier interface can be
  used in conjunction with a constructor reference.
  
. ex8 - This example shows the use of a CompletableFuture to
  concurrently compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two
  BigIntegers.

. ex9 - This example uses a Java 8 ConcurrentHashMap and Java 8
  function-based method reference to compute/cache/retrieve prime
  numbers.

. ex10 - This example shows the use of a lambda expression in the
  context of a Java ConcurrentHashMap removeIf() method.

. ex11 - This example shows the improper use of the Stream.peek()
  aggregate operation to interfere with a running stream.

. ex12 - This program provides several examples of a Java 8 stream
  that show how it can be used with "pure" functions, i.e., functions
  whose return values are only determined by their input values,
  without observable side effects.  This program also shows various
  stream terminal operations, including forEach(), collect(), and
  several variants of reduce().  It also includes a non-Java 8 example
  as a baseline.

. ex13 - This example shows several examples of using Java 8
  Spliterators and streams to traverse each word in a list containing
  a quote from a famous Shakespeare play.

. ex14 - This example shows the difference in overhead for using a
  parallel spliterator to split a Java LinkedList and an ArrayList
  into chunks.  It also shows the difference in overhead between
  combining and collecting LinkedList results in a parallel stream
  vs. sequential stream.

. ex15 - This example shows the limitations of using inherently
  sequential Java 8 streams operations (such as iterate() and limit())
  in the context of parallel streams.

. ex16 - This program implements various ways of computing factorials
  to demonstrate the performance of alternative techniques and the
  dangers of sharing unsynchronized state between threads.

. ex17 -- This example shows various issues associated with using the
  Java 8 stream reduce() terminal operation, including the need to use
  the correct identity value and to ensure operations are associative.
  It also demonstrates what goes wrong when reduce() performs a
  mutable reduction on a parallel stream.

. ex18 -- This program shows how to use a custom collector in
  conjunction with a stream of completable futures.
